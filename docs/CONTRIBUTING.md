### Contribution Steps:
Want to help us out? Here are some steps to make sure you are contributing according to our guidelines.

1. Find an issue you like, or create a new issue [here.](https://github.com/harled/matey/issues)
  
Please ask if you have any questions or need clarification on creating a new issue, or related to any existing issue! 🤔

2. Assign yourself to the issue and create a branch , following GitHub Issue's naming scheme. 🛠️
The naming scheme should follow `(#issueNumber-issue-name)` ie. `(#10-create-new-component)`

3. Get on your local machine and [ensure you have the repo cloned.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) Checkout the branch you just made with `git checkout branch-name` and pull the latest merged changes from the repo with `git pull origin main` to make sure you have the most up-to-date code from the repo. 👩‍💻
4. Add your amazing changes along with any documentation you feel would be useful (ie. Update the README if necessary). Then commit and push your changes. 🌟
5. Go back to the repo on GitHub and create a pull request! Then wait for an admin of the repo to get back to your pull request, address any comments, and once you are finally approved, merge your code into _Matey!_ 🎉
